# 🚀 Dailly JS Project

This repository contains small, beginner-friendly JavaScript projects I build **daily** as part of my learning journey. Each day, I pick a concept and build a mini project using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

## 🔥 Goal

- 💡 Practice DOM manipulation
- 💻 Build logic and UI with plain JavaScript
- 💪 Stay consistent and track growth
- ⚙️ Learn by doing – 1 project per day!

---

## 📁 Structure

Each folder contains:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

Named by day/project for clarity.
