1. Step by step : how to start thinking in logic
Step 1. understand the goal 
Before writing logic, ask:
What do i want to show? 
What do i want to change? 
for example:  To make a StopWatch I want to show time on screen in minutes and seconds format, and update it every second. 


2. Step 2. Think in variable 
What do i need to store? 
What data keeps changing? 


Example : this is for StopWatch 
3. Break the problem into tiny steps
For updateTime();
1. Take total seconds -> (75)
2 . calculate how many minutes  -> (75 / 60) = 1
3. calculate how many minutes -> (75 % 60) = 15
4. calculate how many hours -> 
4. Foramt both as 2 digits 
5. Show it on screen



The common function used in website 

setInterval()  : Runs a function again and again after every time     

clearInterval() : stops the repeating action started by setInterval

querySelector() : selects the first element with class started

addEventListener() : Runs your function when an events happens

Math.floor()  : Rounds a number down to the nearest whole number Math.floor(2.8) -> 3

padStart() : Adds characters at the beginning of a string until it reaches the given length   
string.padStart(totalLength, characterToAdd)
"5".padStart(2,'0')
5 is just 1 charcter long
We want it to be 2 characters long 
So it add one '0' in front->become "05"




Local Stroage : local storage is a built-in Web Api that lets your website store data in browser even after the page is reloaded or the broweser is closed
The data stays until you manually delete it

Basic Operation 
1. Save Something : localStorage.setItem("key","value");  {Example : localStorage.setItem("Username","khushi")};
2. Get Something : localStorage.getItem("username");
3. Remove : localStorage.removeItem("username");
4. Clear : localStorage.clear();
5. JSON.stringify(obj) => (obj->string)
6. JSON.parse(string) => (string->obj)
